# Pokedex-app

I build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

The app displays a searchable list of pokemon names. When the user clicks on the name of a pokemon, a modal appears displaying further details on the pokemon (image, height, weight, and types) fetched from an external API.
